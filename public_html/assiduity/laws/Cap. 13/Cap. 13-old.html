exchange.


   123.  A bill of exchange must be dated, and must specify the<br>place where it is drawn, the sum to be paid, the name of the person<br>who is to pay, and the name of the person to whom or to whose<br>order payment is to be made, the time and place of payment, and<br>the value given, whether in cash, in goods, in account, or in any<br>other manner; and must be signed by the drawer.<br><br><br> Drawer and drawee 
may be the same 
person.


   124.  A bill of exchange can be drawn by a person upon himself,<br>and can be made payable at the same place where it is drawn.<br><br><br> Nullity of bill of 
exchange.


   125.  A bill of exchange signed by means of a cross or any other<br>mark is null.<br><br><br> Discrepancy 
between words and 
figures.


   126. (1) Where in a bill of exchange the sum payable is<br>expressed in words and also in figures, and there is a discrepancy<br>between the two, the sum denoted by the words is the amount<br>payable.<br><br><br>(2) Where the amount is repeatedly expressed in figures or in<br>words, and there is a discrepancy, the smaller amount is the amount<br>payable.<br><br><br> May be drawn to 
order or drawer or 
third party.


   127.  A bill of exchange may be drawn to the order of a third<br>party, or to the order of the drawer himself.<br><br><br> May be drawn on a 
person and made 
payable at 
residence of third 
party.


   128. (1) A bill of exchange may be drawn on a person, and<br>made payable at the place of residence of a third party.<br><br><br>(2) It may be drawn by order and for account of a third party.<br><br><br> Bill in a set.   129. (1) A bill of exchange may be drawn in a set, each part of<br>the set containing a reference thereto by the words first, second,<br>third, etc., in which case each part is equivalent to the whole of the<br>parts, and the whole of the parts constitutes one bill.<br><br><br>(2) In the absence of such reference, each part shall be deemed<br>to be a separate bill.<br><br><br>  OF THE DUTIES OF THE DRAWER<br><br><br> Several parts may 
be required.


  130.  The drawer must deliver to the payee, if the latter so<br>requires, before the bill becomes due, more than one part of the<br>bill.<br><br><br> Supply of funds to 
meet bill.


   131. (1) The drawer, or, where a bill is drawn for account of<br>another party, the party for whose account the bill has been drawn,<br>engages that at the time when the bill becomes due there shall be on<br>his account in the hands of the drawee a supply of funds sufficient<br>for the payment of the bill, even if such bill is payable at the place<br>of residence of a third party.<br><br><br>(2) Nevertheless, the drawer for account of another person<br>remains personally liable towards the payee, the endorsers, and the<br>holder of the bill.<br> <br><br><br><br> When drawee is 
deemed to have 
been put in funds.


   132.  The drawee shall be deemed to have been put in funds if,<br>at the time the bill becomes due, he owes a debt to the drawer, or to<br>the party for whose account the bill was drawn, in an amount not<br>less than that specified in the bill.<br><br><br> Acceptance 
implies supply of 
funds.


   133. (1) An acceptance implies the supply of funds, and<br>constitutes a proof thereof as regards the holders and the endorsers.<br><br><br>(2) The drawer alone, whether the bill be accepted or not, is<br>bound to prove, in case of dispute, that the persons on whom the<br>bill was drawn were provided with the necessary funds for the<br>payment of the bill at maturity; otherwise he is bound to warrant<br>the bill, even though the protest is made after the lapse of the<br>prescribed times.<br><br><br> Protested bills.    134. (1) The holder of a bill which has been protested shall, in<br>no case, be entitled to the funds supplied by the drawer or by the<br>person for whose account the bill was drawn.<br><br><br>(2) If the bill has not been accepted, the funds supplied shall, in<br>case of bankruptcy of the party supplying them, revert to his estate. <br><br><br>(3) If the bill has been accepted, the funds supplied shall<br>remain with the acceptor, subject to his obligation of paying the<br>holder of the bill.<br><br><br> When drawer 
prohibits transfer 
of bill.


   135.  When the drawer has prohibited the transfer of a bill by an<br>express declaration on the bill itself, and this notwithstanding a<br>transfer is made, the endorsee acquires no rights other than those of<br>the payee.<br><br><br>  OF ENDORSEMENT<br><br><br> Transfer by 
endorsement.


  136.  The holder of a bill can transfer the property in it by<br>endorsement.<br><br><br> To whom a bill 
may be endorsed.


   137.  A bill of exchange may be endorsed to the drawee, to the<br>acceptor, to a prior endorser, or even back to the drawer, and may<br>be further endorsed by each and all of them.<br><br><br> Where 
endorsement is 
made.


   138.  The endorsement is made on the back of the bill, or on a<br>slip of paper called an allonge which, when necessary, is attached<br>to the bill itself.<br><br><br> Endorsement may 
be special or in 
blank.


   139.  An endorsement may be made by specifying the name of<br>the person to whom, or to whose order the bill is to be payable, the<br>date of the endorsement, and other particulars; it may also be made<br>in blank by the mere signature of the endorser.<br><br><br> Liability of 
endorser.


   140. (1) The endorser is liable to every succeeding holder for<br>the acceptance and payment of the bill.<br><br><br> Qualified 
endorsement.


   (2) Nevertheless, where the endorsement is qualified by the<br>words "without recourse" or by some other form of words implying<br>a l ike qual i f icat ion, the endorser who has so qual i f ied the<br>endorsement is exempted from all liability on his endorsement.<br>Endorser 
prohibiting transfer 
not liable to 
succeeding 
endorsees.


   141.  Where an endorser has in his endorsement expressly<br>prohibited any further transfer of the bill, the parties to whom such<br>bill is subsequently endorsed have no right of recourse against such<br>endorser.<br><br><br> Effect of restrictive 
endorsement.


   142.  Where the endorsement is made with the order "for<br>collection" or any other expression implying an order by the<br>endorser, such endorsement does not pass the property in the bill,<br>but merely transmits to the endorsee the order therein contained,<br>and in such case the endorsee can only transmit to other parties the<br>same order by a similar endorsement.<br><br><br> Where 
endorsement is 
made after lapse of 
time for protest for 
non-payment or 
non-acceptance.


   143. (1) Where the endorsement is made after the expiration of<br>the time within which the protest for non-payment is to be made,<br>the endorsee acquires, as against the drawee, all the rights arising<br>from the acceptance already made, and the rights of recourse<br>against such parties as shall have endorsed the bill after the lapse of<br>the said time.<br><br><br>(2) The provisions of this article shall also apply where the<br>endorsement is made after the expiration of the time within which<br>the protest for non-acceptance is to be made.<br><br><br> Rights of endorsee 
where endorsement 
is made after 
protest for non-
payment. 


   144.  Where the endorsement is made after the bill has been<br>protested for non-payment, such endorsement shall not vest in the<br>endorsee any rights other than those competent to his endorser<br>against the drawee, if the drawee has accepted the bill, and against<br>such endorsers as may be still liable on the bill.<br><br><br> Rights of endorsee 
against drawer.


   145.  In the cases referred to in the last two preceding articles,<br>the endorsee maintains unimpaired his rights against the drawer,<br>and against the person for whose account the bill was drawn.<br><br><br> Where endorser 
specifies time for 
presentment of bill.


   146.  Where the endorser has in his endorsement specified the<br>time for the presentment of the bill to the drawee, the liability<br>created by the endorsement ceases, if the bill is not presented for<br>acceptance within the time so specified.<br><br><br> Rights of holder 
where bill is not 
endorsed to him. 


   147.  The mere possession of a bill of exchange not endorsed to<br>the holder entitles the holder to present such bill for acceptance,<br>and to protest it for non-acceptance.<br><br><br>  OF ACCEPTANCE<br><br><br> Form of 
acceptance.


  148.  The acceptance of a bill of exchange must be made on the<br>bill itself by the signature of the acceptor, with or without the<br>words "I accept" or "accepted".<br><br><br> When acceptance 
is to be dated.


   149.  The acceptance must be dated, if the bill is payable at a<br>certain period after sight or at usance. The omission of the date of<br>acceptance renders the bill payable at the time specified in the bill,<br>such time to run from the date of such bill.<br><br><br> Acceptance cannot 
be conditional, but 
may be partial.


   150. (1) An acceptance cannot be conditional, but it may be<br>partial as to the amount to be paid.<br> <br><br><br><br>(2) A conditional acceptance shall be deemed to be a refusal to<br>accept.<br><br><br> When bill is to be 
accepted.


   151. (1) A bill of exchange shall be accepted on presentment,<br>or at the latest within twenty-four hours after presentment.<br><br><br>(2) Where, after the expiration of the said time, the bill is not<br>re-delivered, accepted or unaccepted, the party who retained the<br>bill shall be liable in damages and interest to the holder.<br><br><br> Obligations of 
acceptor.


   152. (1) The acceptor of a bill by accepting it engages that he<br>will pay the amount thereof, and cannot be relieved from such<br>engagement, even though the drawer, or the party for whose<br>account the bill was accepted, may, without his knowledge, have<br>become bankrupt previously to the acceptance of the bill.<br><br><br>(2) Nevertheless, when the acceptor has not been put in funds,<br>he may resort to the drawer or to the party for whose account the<br>bill was accepted; in any such case the acceptance raises only a<br>rebuttable presumption against the acceptor, who shall have the<br>right to prove the contrary.<br><br><br> Protest for non-
acceptance.


   153. (1)  A refusal to accept shall be proved by means of a<br>protest termed protest for non-acceptance.<br><br><br>(2) Where the bill is not accepted for the whole amount for<br>which it is drawn, a protest for non-acceptance of the balance shall<br>be made.<br><br><br> Duty of drawer and 
endorsers upon 
notification of 
protest for non-
acceptance.


   154.  Upon notification of the protest mentioned in the last<br>preceding article, the endorsers and the drawer are respectively<br>bound to give sufficient security for the payment at maturity of the<br>amount of the bill or of the amount for which it was not accepted,<br>or to pay the bill together with the expenses of protest and of re-<br>exchange.<br><br><br> Where acceptor’s 
condition changes 
after acceptance of 
bill.


   155.  Where, after the acceptance of the bill, it is proved that the<br>acceptor’s condition, with regard to his commercial affairs, has so<br>changed as to give rise to a reasonable fear that the bill will not be<br>paid at maturity, it shall be lawful to demand against the drawer,<br>the endorsers, and even against the acceptor himself, the same<br>security as that mentioned in the last preceding article.<br><br><br> Obligation of 
surety.


   156.  A person who stands surety for one only of the parties<br>bound to give security, shall be jointly and severally liable only<br>with the party for whom he stands surety.<br><br><br> Promise to accept 
bill.


   157.  A promise to accept a bill of exchange does not amount to<br>an acceptance, but the promisee may maintain an action for<br>damages and interest against the promisor if the latter refuses to<br>perform the promise.<br> OF ACCEPTANCE FOR HONOUR OR BY INTERVENTION<br><br><br> Acceptance for 
honour or by 
intervention.


  158. (1) Where a bill of exchange is protested for non-<br>acceptance, any person, not being a party already liable thereon,<br>may intervene and accept the bill for the honour of the drawer, or of<br>one of the endorsers, with or without an order to that effect from<br>such drawer or endorser.<br><br><br>(2) The drawee himself may, after the protest for non-<br>acceptance, intervene as stranger as aforesaid.<br><br><br> Order of 
preference where 
several persons 
offer to accept for 
honour.


   159. Where several persons offer to accept for honour, the<br>following shall have the preferences:<br><br><br>(a) those who intervene for the drawer or for the party for<br>whose account the bill is drawn;<br><br><br>(b) those who intervene for the endorsers according to the<br>order of the endorsements.<br><br><br> Option of holder.   160.  Where several persons offer to accept by intervention for<br>one and the same party, the holder of the bill may choose any one<br>of them.<br><br><br> Preference to be 
given to party 
instructed to 
intervene.


   161.  Nevertheless, the party instructed to intervene by the<br>person for whom he offers to accept shall, in all cases, have the<br>preference over those who offer to accept for the same person,<br>without such instructions.<br><br><br> Holder of bill may 
accept for honour.


   162.  The holder of a bill of exchange may, as any other person,<br>accept by intervention, and he may, in like circumstances, give the<br>preference to himself.<br><br><br> Acceptance for 
honour how made.


   163.  An acceptance for honour must be written on the bill and<br>be signed by the acceptor for honour, and mention thereof shall be<br>made in the act of protest or in a subsequent act forming an<br>extension thereof or appended thereto.<br><br><br> Duties of acceptor 
for honour.


   164.  The acceptor for honour shall cause the protest for non-<br>acceptance to be delivered to him, and shall, without delay, give<br>notice of his intervention to the party for whose honour he has<br>intervened, and communicate to such party the said protest: in<br>default, he shall be liable in damages and interest.<br><br><br> Where acceptor for 
honour does not 
state for whom he 
intervenes.


   165.  Where the acceptor for honour does not state for whose<br>honour he intervenes, the acceptance shall be deemed to be made<br>for the honour of the drawer, or of the party for whose account the<br>bill is drawn, if the name of such party appears on the bill.<br><br><br> Rights of holder in 
case of acceptance 
for honour.


   166. (1) Notwithstanding any acceptance for honour, the<br>holder of a bil l maintains unimpaired all such rights as are<br>competent to him against the drawer and the endorsers for want of<br>acceptance by the drawee.<br><br><br>(2) Nevertheless, where a reference in case of need has been<br>inserted in the bill by the drawer himself, and the bill is accepted<br>by the referee in case of need, the security mentioned in article 154<br>shall not be competent.<br> <br><br><br><br> Bill accepted for 
honour to be 
presented for 
payment to original 
drawee.


   167. (1) A bill accepted for honour must be presented to the<br>original drawee for payment at the time it falls due, and be<br>protested against him in case of non-payment.<br><br><br>(2) In default of such protest, the acceptor for honour shall not<br>be bound to pay the bill, and if he pays the bill notwithstanding<br>such default, he shall lose his right of recourse against such parties<br>as may have had an interest that the bill be protested against the<br>drawee.<br><br><br>  OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY<br><br><br> Parties to a bill 
jointly and 
severally liable.


  168.  All parties who have signed, accepted, or endorsed a bill,<br>are jointly and severally liable for warranty to the holder.<br><br><br>  OF SURETY PAR AVAL<br><br><br> Aval.   169.  Independently of the acceptance and endorsement, the<br>payment of a bill of exchange can be guaranteed by an aval, which<br>is an obligation of a third party.<br><br><br> How aval is given.    170.  Aval can be given on the bill itself, or by a separate act, or<br>even by letter.<br><br><br> Liability of party 
giving aval.


   171.  The party giving the aval is liable jointly and severally,<br>and in the same manner as the drawer and the endorsers, unless the<br>parties have agreed otherwise.<br><br><br>  OF MATURITY AND PAYMENT<br><br><br> Time of payment.   172. A bill may be expressed to be payable -<br>(a) at sight;<br>(b) at a certain time or on a certain day; <br>(c) at a certain time after sight;<br>(d) at a certain time after date; <br>(e) at usance.<br><br><br> At sight.    173.  A bill expressed to be payable at sight is payable on<br>presentment.<br><br><br> At a certain time or 
on a certain day.


   174.  A bill expressed to be payable at a certain time or on a<br>certain day is payable at the time or on the day expressed therein.<br><br><br> Bill payable in the 
middle of the

   175.  Where a bill is expressed to be payable in the middle of a<br>certain month, the bill shall be deemed to become due on the<br>fifteenth day of that month.<br>Bill payable at a 
certain time after 
sight, or after date.


   176.  A bill expressed to be payable at a certain time after<br>sight, or at a certain time after date, is payable -<br><br><br>(a) if the time is stated in days, on the last day thereof:<br>provided that in the case of a bill expressed to be<br>payable at a certain time after sight, the day on which<br>the bill was presented for acceptance shall not be<br>reckoned, and in the case of a bill expressed to be<br>payable at a certain time after date, the day of the date<br>of the bill shall not be reckoned;<br><br><br>(b) if the time is stated in weeks or months, on the day of<br>the week or month which corresponds, in name or<br>number, with the day on which the bill was presented<br>for acceptance or with the day of the date of the bill:<br>  Provided that where there is no such date in the<br>month of payment, the bill shall be deemed to fall due<br>on the last day of such month.<br><br><br> Half a month.   177.  The time expressed by the words "half a month" shall be<br>equivalent to fifteen days.<br><br><br> Gregorian 
calendar.


   178.  The months are reckoned according to the Gregorian<br>calendar.<br><br><br> Bill payable at 
usance.


   179.  A bill expressed to be payable at usance is payable at<br>twenty-one days from the day on which the bill was presented for<br>acceptance.<br><br><br> Where no time is 
expressed, bill is 
payable at sight.
